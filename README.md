# matlang -a-made-up-language- to c transcriptor

## purpose
the purpose of this project is to practice some of the core parts of the compilers: parsing, syntax analyzing, and type inference.

## what it does
it checks the syntax validity and matrix dimension compliance of the language matlang and transcripts the given script to equivalent c code.

### matlang
we defined a made up language called `matlang` that has its own syntax and semantics rules. it is a very simple and restricted language whose purpose is to make some straightforward operations with matrices: scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, addition.
in this language, there is no branching structure like if-else or switch-case. It only supports for loops which can be nested up to a maximum of two levels.
